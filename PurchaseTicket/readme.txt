The design makes use of multiple functions, while loops, switch statement, and if else statements. We had to me a program that simulates the selling of tickets to customers, with each ticket having different prices. The program would ask the user to select the type of ticket they would like and how many they would like to purchase. The program would then give the total amount to be paid depending on the ticket type and how many tickets were bought.
